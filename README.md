# JavaTetris
### Hello, this is a tetris game i made as a tiny project to learn Java, using most of what Java can offer.
This was made using Java 8 and a graphical library which you can find [here](https://www.dlsi.ua.es/asignaturas/prog3/Tetris_OO/p4/tetrisgui.jar)

### This project uses:
- Custom exception handling.
- Junit tests.
- Factories.
- Dependencies and library usage.
- Inheritance between classes, interfaces and abstract classes.
- Reflections.
